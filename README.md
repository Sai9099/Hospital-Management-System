I developed a software application designed to streamline and manage day-to-day hospital operations. The system helps in:
âœ… Managing patient records & appointments
âœ… Handling staff information & scheduling
âœ… Generating billing and payment details
âœ… Tracking inventory and resources

ðŸ”§ Key Features:

Centralized database for patient and staff records

Role-based access for administrators, doctors, and staff

Appointment scheduling & notifications

Automated billing & inventory management

This project reflects how technology can improve healthcare efficiency by reducing manual work, minimizing errors, and enhancing overall hospital workflows.

ðŸ’¡ It was a great opportunity to practice database design, backend development, and UI/UX integration while solving real-world healthcare management challenges.

Always happy to connect with others working on healthcare tech and software solutions! ðŸ™Œ
